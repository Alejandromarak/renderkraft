RenderKraft â€” Static Architecture Portfolio (GitHub Pages)

Overview
RenderKraft is a fully static, animation-rich portfolio site for an architecture studio specializing in interior and exterior design. The site is built using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and styled-components rendered client-side across Home, Projects, Project Detail, Services, About, and Contact pages. The experience emphasizes cinematic hero moments, a refined filterable gallery, and narrative case studies, while remaining performant and accessible on GitHub Pages.
